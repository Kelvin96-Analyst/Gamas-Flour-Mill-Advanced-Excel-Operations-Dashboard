# Gamas Flour Mill – Advanced Excel Operations Dashboard

## 📌 Project Title
**Advanced Excel Daily Operations Dashboard for Gamas Flour Mill**

## 🏭 Company Context (Adapted)
Gamas Flour Mill is a high-capacity flour manufacturing operation processing multiple wheat grades for bread flour, confectionery flour, and semolina. Operations are driven by two milling lines:

- **Mill A – Primary Production Line**: High-volume, continuous operation supplying bulk flour demand.
- **Mill B – Flexible / Specialty Line**: Handles durum wheat, specialty blends, and short production runs.

This project simulates real operational data and demonstrates how Excel can be used as a **decision-support tool** for production managers, operations analysts, and plant leadership.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
To design a **dynamic, interactive Excel dashboard** that provides daily visibility into:

- Flour output performance
- Mill utilization and downtime
- Maintenance cost behavior
- Wheat-type impact on production efficiency
- Early warning alerts for operational risks

The dashboard supports **data-driven decision-making** to improve Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), reduce downtime, and optimize wheat usage at Gamas Flour Mill.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
**Period:** July 1 – July 8, 2025  
**Source:** Simulated daily production log (realistic for Nigerian flour milling operations)

| Field | Description |
|------|------------|
| Date | Production day |
| Mill Line | Mill A or Mill B |
| Wheat Type | Hard Red, Soft White, Durum |
| Status | Operational / Delayed / Failed |
| Daily Flour Output (Tons) | Finished flour produced |
| Mill Utilization (%) | Capacity utilization |
| Daily Maintenance Cost (₦ equivalent) | Maintenance spend |
