# Gamas Flour Mill – Advanced Excel Operations Dashboard

## Project Title
**Advanced Excel Daily Operations Dashboard for Gamas Flour Mill**

## Company Context
Gamas Flour Mill is a high-capacity flour manufacturing operation processing multiple wheat grades for bread flour, confectionery flour, and semolina. Operations are driven by two milling lines:

- **Mill A – Primary Production Line**: High-volume, continuous operation supplying bulk flour demand.
- **Mill B – Flexible / Specialty Line**: Handles durum wheat, specialty blends, and short production runs.

This project simulates real operational data and demonstrates how Excel can be used as a **decision-support tool** for production managers, operations analysts, and plant leadership.

## Project Objective
This portfolio project demonstrates the design and implementation of a fully dynamic Excel based operations dashboard for Gamas Flour Mill manufacturing facility producing 800–1,000 tons of flour per day.

Using real world inspired daily production data from two parallel milling lines (Mill A and Mill B), this project applies advanced Excel formulas (SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS, COUNTIFS, RANK.AVG, INDEX/MATCH, dynamic thresholds, conditional formatting, slicers, and PivotCharts) to deliver actionable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that flour mill managers, production supervisors, and maintenance teams rely on every day.

The goal is to enable instant visibility into production performance, mill utilization, downtime causes, maintenance costs, and wheat type efficiency, ultimately supporting faster decision making, preventive maintenance scheduling, and continuous improvement of Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) in a highly competitive flour industry.




To design a **dynamic, interactive Excel dashboard** that provides daily visibility into:

- Flour output performance
- Mill utilization and downtime
- Maintenance cost behavior
- Wheat-type impact on production efficiency
- Early warning alerts for operational risks

The dashboard supports **data-driven decision-making** to improve Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), reduce downtime, and optimize wheat usage at Gamas Flour Mill.

## Dataset Overview
**Period:** July 1 – July 8, 2025 

| Field | Description |
|------|------------|
| Date | Production day |
| Mill Line | Physical milling unit (Mill A or Mill B) |
| Wheat Type | Grade of wheat being processed (Hard Red, Soft White, Durum) |
| Status | Operational / Delayed / Failed |
| Daily Flour Output (Tons) | Finished flour produced |
| Mill Utilization (%) | Capacity utilization |
| Daily Maintenance Cost ($ equivalent) | Maintenance spend |

##Sample Dataset
The dataset represents 8 days of operations in July 2023 for Gamas flour mill with two lines processing different wheat types.
